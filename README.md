# OpenGL Book Examples

I am currently learning OpenGL by reading "The OpenGL Book" available online at
[http://openglbook.com](http://openglbook.com)

This repository contains sample code for each of the chapters.

### Building on OSX

Install dependencies:

```
brew install glfw3
```

Build the project:

```
# generate makefile for your platform
cmake .

# build examples
make
```

Run an example:

```
./build/chapter_1
```

### Building Windows & Linux

TODO when I have the time
